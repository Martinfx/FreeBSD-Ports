clang-uml is an automatic C++ to UML class, sequence, package and include diagram generator,
driven by YAML configuration files. The main idea behind the project is to easily maintain
up-to-date diagrams within a code-base or document legacy code. The configuration file or
files for clang-uml define the types and contents of each generated diagram.
