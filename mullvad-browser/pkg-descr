When you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, 
third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. 
That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. 
However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, 
you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. 
That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – 
a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.
