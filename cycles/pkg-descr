Cycles is an open-source production-ready path tracer with unified CPU/GPU
rendering. It supports interactive workflows including progressive and
tiled rendering with fast updates to objects, shaders and lights.
The engine handles modern scene geometry (meshes, curves, volumes),
instancing, motion blur and adaptive subdivision/displacement.
It delivers physically based shading, node-based materials and lights,
volumetric scattering/emission and full lighting suites including
global illumination and environment lights. Support GPU rendering on
NVIDIA, AMD, Intel and Apple Silicon hardware.
