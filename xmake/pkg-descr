XMake is a make utility.  It is not compatible with other makes, but
provides extended functionality over most standard makes.  Whereas most
other makes have confusing rulesets and do not support many-to-many
dependency specifications, XMake has relatively few (basically no) rulesets
and allows you to easily specify many:many dependencies.  This gives XMake
the flexibility to deal with complex project hierarchies very simply.
