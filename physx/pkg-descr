Modeling digital twins of factories, cities, or entire worlds involves complex simulations 
that must accurately replicate the physical behavior of objects and systems, 
which are foundational in building generative physical AI for 
powering the next generation of autonomous systems.  
NVIDIA PhysXÂ® is a scalable, multi-physics SDK for simulating and modeling
physics in Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles, and VFX workflows.
