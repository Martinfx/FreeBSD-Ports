# Brave Browser


## Overview

This repository holds the build tools needed to build the Brave desktop browser for macOS, Windows, and Linux.  In particular, it fetches and syncs code from the projects defined in `package.json` and `src/brave/DEPS`:

  - [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git)
    - Fetches code via `depot_tools`.
    - sets the branch for Chromium (ex: 65.0.3325.181).
  - [brave-core](https://github.com/brave/brave-core)
    - Mounted at `src/brave`.
    - Maintains patches for 3rd party Chromium code.
  - [adblock-rust](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust)
    - Implements Brave's ad-block engine.
    - Linked through [brave/adblock-rust-ffi](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/tree/master/components/adblock_rust_ffi).

## Install prerequisites

Follow the instructions for your platform:

- [macOS](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/macOS-Development-Environment)
- [Windows](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Windows-Development-Environment)
- [Linux/Android](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Linux-Development-Environment)

## Clone and initialize the repo

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can get the code and initialize the build environment.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brave/brave-core.git path-to-your-project-folder/src/brave
cd path-to-your-project-folder/src/brave
npm install

# the Chromium source is downloaded, which has a large history (gigabytes of data)
# this might take really long to finish depending on internet speed

npm run init
```
brave-core based android builds should use `npm run init -- --target_os=android --target_arch=arm` (or whichever CPU type you want to build for)

You can also set the target_os and target_arch for init and build using:

```
npm config set target_os android
npm config set target_arch arm
```

## Build Brave
The default build type is component.

```
# start the component build compile
npm run build
```

To do a release build:

```
# start the release compile
npm run build Release
```

brave-core based android builds should use `npm run build -- --target_os=android --target_arch=arm` or set the npm config variables as specified above for `init`

### Build Configurations

Running a release build with `npm run build Release` can be very slow and use a lot of RAM, especially on Linux with the Gold LLVM plugin.

To run a statically linked build (takes longer to build, but starts faster):

```bash
npm run build -- Static
```

To run a debug build (Component build with is_debug=true):

```bash
npm run build -- Debug
```
NOTE: the build will take a while to complete. Depending on your processor and memory, it could potentially take a few hours.

Brave staff may also want to try [Goma](https://github.com/brave/devops/wiki/Faster-browser-builds#goma) for faster builds.

## Run Brave
To start the build:

`npm start [Release|Component|Static|Debug]`

# Update Brave

`npm run sync -- [--force] [--init] [--create] [brave_core_ref]`

**This will attempt to stash your local changes in brave-core, but it's safer to commit local changes before running this**

`npm run sync` will (depending on the below flags):

1. üì• Update sub-projects (chromium, brave-core) to latest commit of a git ref (e.g. tag or branch)
2. ü§ï Apply patches
3. üîÑ Update gclient DEPS dependencies
4. ‚è© Run hooks (e.g. to perform `npm install` on child projects)

| flag | Description |
|---|---|
|`[no flags]`|updates chromium if needed and re-applies patches. If the chromium version did not change, it will only re-apply patches that have changed. Will update child dependencies **only if any project needed updating during this script run**. <br> **Use this if you want the script to manage keeping you up to date instead of pulling or switching branches manually. **|
|`--force`|updates both _Chromium_ and _brave-core_ to the latest remote commit for the current brave-core branch and the _Chromium_ ref specified in brave-browser/package.json (e.g. `master` or `74.0.0.103`). Will re-apply all patches. Will force update all child dependencies. <br> **Use this if you're having trouble and want to force the branches back to a known state. **|
|`--init`|force update both _Chromium_ and _brave-core_ to the versions specified in brave-browser/package.json and force updates all dependent repos - same as `npm run init`|
|`--sync_chromium (true/false)`|Will force or skip the chromium version update when applicable. Useful if you want to avoid a minor update when not ready for the larger build time a chromium update may result in. A warning will be output about the current code state expecting a different chromium version. Your build may fail as a result.|
|`-D, --delete_unused_deps`|Will delete from the working copy any dependencies that have been removed since the last sync. Mimics `gclient sync -D`.|

Run `npm run sync brave_core_ref` to checkout the specified _brave-core_ ref and update all dependent repos including chromium if needed.

## Scenarios

#### Create a new branch:
```bash
brave-browser> cd src/brave
brave-browser/src/brave> git checkout -b branch_name
```

#### Checkout an existing branch or tag:
```bash
brave-browser/src/brave> git fetch origin
brave-browser/src/brave> git checkout [-b] branch_name
brave-browser/src/brave> npm run sync
...Updating 2 patches...
...Updating child dependencies...
...Running hooks...
```

#### Update the current branch to the latest remote:
```bash
brave-browser/src/brave> git pull
brave-browser/src/brave> npm run sync
...Updating 2 patches...
...Updating child dependencies...
...Running hooks...
```

#### Reset to latest brave-browser master and brave-core master (via `init`, will always result in a longer build and will remove any pending changes in your brave-core working directory):
```bash
brave-browser> git checkout master
brave-browser> git pull
brave-browser> npm run sync -- --init
```

#### When you know that DEPS didn't change, but .patch files did (quickest attempt to perform a mini-sync before a build):
```bash
brave-browser/src/brave> git checkout featureB
brave-browser/src/brave> git pull
brave-browser/src/brave> cd ../..
brave-browser> npm run apply_patches
...Applying 2 patches...
```
