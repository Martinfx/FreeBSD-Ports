📦 FreeBSD Ports & My Contributions

The FreeBSD Ports Collection is the official way to compile and install third-party applications on FreeBSD. Each port contains the metadata, patches, and instructions needed to automatically download, build, and install a piece of software from source code, handling dependencies along the way.

While FreeBSD already includes tens of thousands of ports for a huge variety of software, there are always applications that need porting, updating, or maintenance — especially to keep them compatible with modern releases or to fix build issues on specific architectures.

I’m actively working on porting and maintaining applications for FreeBSD — including:
* creating new ports for software that hasn’t been available yet,
* fixing build failures and updating dependencies,
* ensuring clean and reproducible builds across architectures,
* contributing patches upstream and into the FreeBSD Ports tree.

If you find this work useful and would like to support my ongoing porting efforts, consider backing the project through Patreon or other support channels. Your contributions help me dedicate more time to development, testing, and improving support for FreeBSD users everywhere.
